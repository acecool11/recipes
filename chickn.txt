"A whole chicken cut into pieces and baked with a simple mixture of olive oil, chicken stock, garlic, spices and cheese - topped with balsamic vinegar just before serving. The best Chicken Savoy on the planet is served at the Belmont Tavern in Bloomfield, where it was invented by Stretch himself. Go there, order Savoy for two, and order Zita with pot cheese. They make a wonderful combination. The place is not fancy, but the food is outstanding. This is a recipe to eat with your fingers and get juices on your hands. Yum!"
